# Crypto Encryption with PyFernet

This project demonstrates basic cryptography using Python with the Fernet encryption module. It allows you to convert plaintext into encrypted text and keeps a log of the encryption key and the data in a text file.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the Cryptography Python library installed. You can install it using the following command:



#Usage
To use this encryption tool, follow the steps below:

Run the Python script in your preferred environment.
Input the text you want to encrypt when prompted.

#Example
Input:
     "Secure message for SOC Analyst"
Output:

  Encryption Key: b'_q7BxbXgXSdKQS6GYQBmkMiX-BHzh3UW6YgnZMqFbdY='
  Key generated on: 2021-11-01 12:45:30.234567

  Encrypted Text: b'gAAAAABgKCOAy_N-JpVwIQ8JHmDL6LEzv0schf4fGs0Mmw-ilUkljOrQXyhtsWdoNtTqWu9fBqK63dSJxLzuF8TLMZSKcqGctQ=='
  Decrypted Text: b'Secure message for SOC Analyst'
